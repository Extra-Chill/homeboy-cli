# Homeboy CLI

CLI tool for development and deployment automation.

## Installation

### Homebrew
```bash
brew tap extra-chill/tap
brew install homeboy
```

This installs the **Homeboy CLI** (`homeboy`). It does not install the macOS desktop app.

### Cargo (requires Rust)

## Usage

```bash

homeboy projects

# Switch active project
homeboy project switch myproject

# Run WP-CLI command
homeboy wp myproject core version

# Deploy a component
homeboy deploy myproject my-plugin

# SSH into server
homeboy ssh myproject

# View logs
homeboy logs show myproject debug.log -f
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the Homeboy data directory (via `dirs::data_dir()`):
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Homeboy/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Homeboy/` (exact path varies by distribution)

The macOS desktop app (if installed) uses the same directory and JSON structure, but it is not required for CLI usage.

```
Homeboy/
├── config.json           # Active project ID
├── projects/             # Project configurations
├── servers/              # Server configurations
├── components/           # Component configurations
├── modules/              # Installed modules
└── keys/                 # SSH keys (e.g. server-foo-bar_id_rsa)
```

## SSH Setup

By default, Homeboy uses your system SSH configuration (including `~/.ssh/config`, SSH agent, Keychain, 1Password, etc.). No Homeboy-managed key file is required.

Optional: configure an explicit identity file for a server:

```bash
# Use an existing private key path (does not copy the key)
homeboy server key use server-example-com ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Revert to normal SSH resolution
homeboy server key unset server-example-com
```

Optional: have Homeboy generate or import a key into the Homeboy data directory and set it for the server:

```bash
# Generate a new keypair
homeboy server key generate server-example-com

# Or import an existing private key (Homeboy copies it into Homeboy/keys/)
homeboy server key import server-example-com ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

To print the public key (for `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`):

```bash
homeboy server key show server-example-com --raw
```
